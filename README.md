# Multiplayer 2d car physics with JavaScript!

https://car.js.org
Use keyboard (up/down/left/right/space, w/s/a/d/space), touch screen (swipe up, down, left, right + shoot with second finger) or gamepad.

All code [here](https://github.com/pakastin/car/blob/master/car.js)! Not real car physics, but a simple way to do nice little drifting ðŸ˜›

Skidmarks are rendered with canvas and car is just a simple DIV element. Web socket server is here: https://github.com/pakastin/car-ws
